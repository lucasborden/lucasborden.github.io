              <strong>Abstract:</strong>
              <em>
                Where most existing literature on fertility preferences has described how fertility
                preferences shape outcomes, this paper provides insight into how the sex of a recent
                birth affects a mother’s fertility preferences. Utilizing data from the Demographic
                Health Survey from 1985-2020 in 81 countries containing 309,238 mothers who gave
                birth in the past 12 months and who have equal to or fewer than three children, I
                employ OLS with two-way fixed effects as my primary specification, examining the
                effects of the plausibly exogenous sex of a recent birth on sibship sex composition
                preferences. Results show that a recent daughter birth increases a mother’s stated
                ideal number of daughters by roughly 0.1 while decreasing the ideal number of sons
                by about 0.06. Additionally, a recent daughter birth raises the ideal number of
                total children by 0.04, but this result is less robust to endogeneity. Previous
                literature has emphasized the power of the firstborn child in shaping a mother’s
                preferences, but this paper displays that mothers continuously update their
                preferences past the first birth in magnitudes statistically analogous to treatment
                effects of the first birth. Treatment effects of a recent daughter birth are
                directionally homogeneous across different model specifications and when testing for
                heterogeneous treatment effects across a variety of distinct subsamples.
                Convincingly, results can be explained within the framework of cognitive dissonance
                theory, ex-post rationalization, and contact theory. Considering the persistence and
                directional homogeneity of the results, a novel psychological regularity emerges:
                mothers with a recent daughter birth prefer a greater ideal number of daughters and
                a lower ideal number of sons when compared to those who recently birthed a son.

              <strong>Summary:</strong>
              <em>
                "A Quilt of Spirit" aims to encapsulate the essence of fieldwork, shedding light on
                its challenges and rewards. It delves into the spellbinding culture of Kadaba, its
                warm-hearted residents, and its rich cultural heritage. It offers a glimpse into the
                sweltering heat and humidity of Southern India, along with the devastating,
                inevitable realities of food poisoning. Above all, though, it highlights how
                life-changing the experience of conducting fieldwork in the social sciences can be
                for an aspiring researcher.
